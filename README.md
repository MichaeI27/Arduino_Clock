# 3D-7-Segment-Digital-Clock

This is the source and schema for another homemade digital clock I've made. Here's a link to the [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/QDYH36tWzoY)

Keep in mind that it takes a long time to print all the parts and in daylight it's not very bright.
You can download the Android app from the Play Story here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.leonvandenbeukel.BTDigitalClockApp

### Print instructions

For better contrast, it's best to print the following parts in black:

* Betweenblock
* BewteenSegments
* DotRing
* Dotbottom
* Middle
* OuterRingSegments

The rest can be printed in white.
